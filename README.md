## ðŸ›¡ Architecture Overview

1. **User Authentication**  
   Register/login via email and password â†’ receive JWT in a secure, HttpOnly cookie.
2. **Dashboard & Data Fetching**  
   Frontend loads list of candidates and fetches notes on candidate page.
3. **Socket.IO**  
   Clients join a `candidateId` room on page load.  
   Sending a note triggers both a REST POST and a Socket.IO event.
4. **Real-Time Events**  
   Backend saves note â†’ emits `receiveNote` to all clients in the candidate room.  
   Detects `@mentions` â†’ creates notifications in MongoDB â†’ emits `notification` to online tagged users.
5. **Frontend Notifications**  
   Clients handle `notification` events â†’ display toast & add to global notifications UI.
6. **Navigation & Cleanup**  
   Clicking a notification navigates to the note view + highlights the item. Notifications can be deleted.
